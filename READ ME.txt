Before running the server, do the following
1) Run 'npm install' on root directory
2) Move 'dataset' folder in /app/import/
** Note that if the 'dataset' directory name is changed, the path in importJSON.js and update.js, and app/controllers/analytics.server.controller.js will also needed to be changed.
** The JSON files should be located in dataset/revisions
** The admin_.txt and bot.txt should be located in dataset/
3) On terminal, cd to /app/import/
4) Run 'node importJSON'
5) Run 'node update'. After the update for all 8 user types have been completed, force end the execution (^C).
5) cd back to root directory
6) Run 'node server' or 'npm start'
